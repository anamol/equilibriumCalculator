Chemical Equilibrium Calculator
=====================

This program calculates the equilibrium  concentration of chemical species through Gibbs energy minimization, given a full chemical kinetic mechanism. The process is detailed in  S. Gordon, B. J.McBride; Computer Program for Calculation of Complex Chemical Equilibrium Compositions and Applications. A shorter summary is included in J. C. Kramlich; General Gibbs Minimization as an Approach to Equilibrium. The latter is included in the repo, "gibbs_min.pdf"
